# Search all of github and you will not see a repo like this. 

EACH app is in its own folder/subfolder. MOST apps are just rust code in main.rs and the tiny Cargo toml file. As such, the apps are incredibly easy to feed to ai to audit, update or change. The cardinal sin of crypto is "hand rolling" your own apps- ESPECIALLY all the apps that are on git that say made with pure rust (no crates). Depending on a well vetted crate is much safer. Using battle tested and well vetted apps like Rage or picocrypt or something is best in most cases. As ai gets better all the time, a small, simple one page of code that can be audited and updated by ai has potential to catch up to the best apps on earth. In some cases ai can do the work of a thousand people- but ai understands everything at once. So the entire notion of the best code in the world made by any human is just laughable as ai gets better and better.

# Human coders feel less power day by day. 
Tech streamers/youtubers used to make people stupider by making videos that go in circles- the lang of the week, this and that in a vortex of pure stupidity and click bait. The absolute truth is you can learn more from a 10 minute session with ai than you can by seeing 5 months of a degenerate ass clown click bait youtuber.
