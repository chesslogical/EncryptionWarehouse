# kiss  encryption 


Keep It Simple Stupid (kiss) method. dead simple cli encryption apps. 

Each folder is its own app. 

Most have ONE command (the file name to encrypt) . Automatically encrypts or decrypts the file in place. 

Made ONLY for linux. That is because atomic overwrite operations are a bit different in linux than windows or mac.

Modern high security algos.  The code in here would take someone an incredible level of skill and lots of time to dev- ai made each app in about 15 minutes each on average, i just fed back the error messages till it passed the strict rust compiler. Then i fed the app to an entirely different ai and told it to be highly critical. Then i fed the audit to the original ai and told it to fix the things it agrees with. 

The code is simple but incredibly powerful. It is decent- very much so as is- but it is made to be flexible, able to be updated easily. I do not think one could ask for more from an encryption app. 

I do NOT do version control i just overwrite to make edits. 


Crates change, ai gets better, and stuff happens. I made this super easy to feed each app to ai in order to update, change or audit. As such, all the apps here work- but are made with the future in mind. They are all designed to be more of a working starter kit than a working app. So do NOT let this being archived fool ya. There is awesome code in this repo. I see lots of rust encryption apps on git, i never found a repo like this..where full working code was just in main.rs  EVERY folder is its own work of art- it works but is easily editable and easily customized.
