Yes, the byte-converter tool (using Base64) can reliably convert any file type from binary to text and back, as long as you provide the correct input/output paths—it treats all files as raw byte streams, so the file extension or type doesn't matter. This works for text files, images (.jpg, .png), executables (.exe, .bin), PDFs, archives (.zip), videos, or anything else, with lossless round-trip conversion. Just ensure the output file during decoding has the original extension if needed for software recognition.
